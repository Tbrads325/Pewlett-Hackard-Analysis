- Foremost the chart above shows how large the "silver tsunami" will actually be with employees retiring by the thousands in multiple departments.

- Specifically, many Senior staff memebers will be leaving/retiring in the near future. This will leave a substantial need for current employees to fill these roles. The
importance of the mentorship program is truly highlighted by this finding and the need for it to succeed.

- The above mentioned chart shows that many of the employees eligible for mentorship roles have already made the jump to senior/leadership positions already. Therefore the program
would be of no use to them and the company actually, has fewer individuals than thought previously to fill vacancies.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation
of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The good thing about so many individuals retiring is that there are more than enough individuals to mentor the next generation. However, Pewlett Hackard needs to hire more individuals. The number of 
employees eligable for the mentorship program is not even close to the number of positions that need to be filled as shown by the chart above. Additionally, many of these employees are already in 
leadership positions and would not take part in the mentorship program at all. Thus, Pewlett Hackard needs to hire more individuals to take part in the mentorship program before employees begin to retire.

- Finally, the chart above gives an idea of how much it will cost to replace the retiring employees based on the avg salary per position. Not only does Pewlett Hackard need to replace the retiring employees, but it also
realistically figure out how much it is going to cost in the future to continue to pay this number of employees.
